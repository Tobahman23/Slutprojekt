## Slutprojekt
This project was my final project in year 3 of my tech studies. In this project I have demonstrated some of my knowledge of php and mysql. Unfortunately Github cannot show php sites, but the site was meant to be a guide for people visiting stockholm. The php page includes a weather api for Stockholm, buildings you can visit and restaurant where you can eat. 

A lot of the site was constructed via include which is a php method i used a lot in this project. The log-in and sign-up form was made in 
correspondence with mysql to easily store usernames and passwords etc. Cookies was used in the project for text-color preference since I had a background on the site that I didn't want to change with a dark mode possibility, but I still wanted to make some kind off design choice with cookies. 

This project taught me a lot of my current knowledge in php and it helped me understand php better. If I remade this project today I believe I could have made it even better than how it turned out.
